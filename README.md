# template netlify app ![tests](https://github.com/nichoth/template-netlify-app/actions/workflows/nodejs.yml/badge.svg)

A template for applications using [preact](https://preactjs.com/),
[htm](https://github.com/developit/htm/tree/master),
[typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/),
and [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) as host.
Use [tape-run](https://github.com/juliangruber/tape-run) for tests in a browser
environment.

See
[template-ts-preact-htm-app](https://github.com/nichoth/template-ts-preact-htm-app)
for the same thing, but not using netlify.

See [template-ts-preact-htm](https://github.com/nichoth/template-ts-preact-htm)
for something similar but for dependency modules.

## use

1. Use the template button in github. Or clone this
   then `rm -rf .git && git init`. 
2. Then `npm i && npm init`.
3. Edit the source code in `src/`.
4. Add the project to [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), and add a link to the
   netlify site in the README file.

## featuring

* `preversion` npm hook -- lint.
* `postversion` npm hook -- `git push && git push --tags`
* eslint via [standardx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/standardx) -- `npm run lint`
* test in a browser environment via `tape-run` -- see `npm test`.
  Includes `tap` testing tools -- [tapzero](https://github.com/nichoth/tapzero) and [tap-arc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tap-arc)
* CI via github actions
* routing via [route-event](https://github.com/nichoth/route-event) and
  [@nichoth/routes](https://github.com/nichoth/routes)

## develop

Start a localhost server, and serve the netlify serverless functions locally.
Note the lambda functions are accessible at the path `/api/` from the
frontend code.

```sh
npm start
```

## architecture

See [this article](https://gomakethings.com/easier-state-management-with-preact-signals/)
for more details about application architecture.

We create application state and logic in the file
[./src/state.ts](./src/state.ts). This exports static functions, creates
a state object, and sets up URL routing.

In the view code, you would call the functions exposed in
[state](./src/state.ts) with a state instance in response to
application events.
